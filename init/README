These are the configuration files to start the processes automatically using
systemctl. They go in the /etc/systemd/system directory

The file 'house' is the logrotate config file I use.

The file UPS files I modified for ups control go into the /etc/apcupsd directoryexcept the script apcupsd, it goes into /etc/initd and links into rc0.d
