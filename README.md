Desert-Home
===========
Collection of the Desert-Home projects that run on the Raspberry Pi.

The documentation for these are held on my blog at Desert-Home.com.

There will eventually be a companion directory for the Arduino based portion
of the projects here on GitHub, I just haven't started it yet.
